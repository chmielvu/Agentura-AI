# Agentic AI Systems: A Primer

An agentic AI system is a program that can perceive its environment, make decisions, and take actions to achieve specific goals. Unlike traditional programs, agentic systems exhibit a degree of autonomy.

The core components of an agent often include:
- **Perception**: How the agent takes in information (e.g., text, images, tool outputs).
- **Planning**: Decomposing a large goal into smaller, manageable steps.
- **Action**: Executing a tool or generating a response.
- **Memory**: Storing past interactions and learned information to inform future decisions. A key pattern is the Reflexion loop, where an agent critiques its own work to improve.
